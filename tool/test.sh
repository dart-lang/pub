# invocation requires the dart compiler to load all the sources. This script
# will create a `pub.XXX.dart.snapshot.dart2` which the tests can utilize.
# After creating the snapshot this script will forward arguments to
# `pub run test`, and ensure that the snapshot is deleted after tests have been
# run.
