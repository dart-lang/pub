3 upgradable dependencies are locked (in pubspec.lock) to older versions.
To update these dependencies, use `pub upgrade`.

1 dependency is constrained to a version that is older than a resolvable version.
To update it, edit pubspec.yaml.

$ pub outdated --no-color --mode=null-safety
Running in 'null safety' mode.
Showing packages where the current version doesn't fully support null safety.
