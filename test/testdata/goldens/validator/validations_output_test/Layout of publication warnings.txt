Validating package...
Package validation found the following 4 errors:
* You must have a LICENSE file in the root directory.
  An open-source license helps ensure people can legally use your code.

* Your pubspec.yaml is missing a "description" field.

* Your pubspec.yaml is missing a "version" field.

* line 1, column 1 of bin/main.dart: foo is in the `dev_dependencies` section of `pubspec.yaml`. Packages used in bin/ must be declared in the `dependencies` section.
    ╷
  1 │ import 'package:foo/foo.dart';
    │ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Package validation found the following 5 potential issues:
* `dart analyze` found the following issue(s):
  Analyzing bin, pubspec.yaml...
  
  warning - bin/main.dart:1:8 - Unused import: 'package:foo/foo.dart'. Try removing the import directive. - unused_import
  
  1 issue found.
  

* It's strongly recommended to include a "homepage" or "repository" field in your pubspec.yaml

* Your dependency on "bar" should have a version constraint. For example:
  
  dependencies:
    bar: ^1.0.0
  
  Without a constraint, you're promising to support all future versions of "bar".

* Please add a README.md file that describes your package.

* Please add a `CHANGELOG.md` to your package. See https://dart.dev/tools/pub/publishing#important-files.

Package validation found the following hint:
* Non-dev dependencies are overridden in pubspec.yaml.
  
  This indicates you are not testing your package against the same versions of its
  dependencies that users will have when they use it.
  
  This might be necessary for packages with cyclic dependencies.
  
  Please be extra careful when publishing.
[STDERR] Sorry, your package is missing some requirements and can't be published yet.
