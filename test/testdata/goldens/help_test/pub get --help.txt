$ pub get --help
Get the current package's dependencies.

Usage: pub get
-h, --help                Print this usage information.
    --[no-]offline        Use cached packages instead of accessing the network.
    --check-up-to-date    Do a fast timestamp-based check to see resolution is up-to-date and internally
                          consistent.
                          
                          If timestamps are correctly ordered, exit 0, and do not check the external sources for
                          newer versions.
                          
                          Combined with --dry-run will output non-zero if the resolution seems not up-to-date.
                          Otherwise redo the resolution.
-n, --dry-run             Report what dependencies would change but don't change any.
    --enforce-lockfile    Enforce pubspec.lock. Fail `pub get` if the current `pubspec.lock` does not exactly specify a valid resolution of `pubspec.yaml` or if any content hash of a hosted package
                          has changed.
                          Useful for CI or deploying to production.
    --[no-]precompile     Build executables in immediate dependencies.
    --[no-]example        Also run in `example/` (if it exists).
                          (defaults to on)
-C, --directory=<dir>     Run this in the directory <dir>.
