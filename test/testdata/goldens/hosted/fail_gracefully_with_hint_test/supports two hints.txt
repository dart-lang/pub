Resolving dependencies...
[STDERR] Because foo <1.2.4 requires the Flutter SDK and foo >=1.2.4 depends on bar any, every version of foo requires bar any.
[STDERR] So, because bar doesn't exist (could not find package bar in cache) and myapp depends on foo any, version solving failed.
[STDERR] 
[STDERR] Flutter users should run `flutter pub get` instead of `dart pub get`.
