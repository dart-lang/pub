    // The foo package has two self-transformers: foo/first and foo/second,
    // loaded in that order. This means that *no instances of foo/first*
    // should ever have their code transformed by foo/second.

    // The myapp package also has a reference to foo/first. This reference has
    // a different configuration than foo's, which means that if it's loaded
    // in a separate isolate, it will be loaded after all of foo's
    // transformers have run. This means that foo/first.dart will have been
    // transformed by foo/first and foo/second, causing it to have different
    // code than the previous instance. This tests asserts that that doesn't
    // happen.
