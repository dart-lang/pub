/// A source from which to get packages.
///
/// Each source has many packages that it looks up using [PackageId]s. Sources
/// that inherit this directly (currently just [PathSource]) are *uncached*
/// sources. They deliver a package directly to the package that depends on it.
///
/// Other sources are *cached* sources. These extend [CachedSource]. When a
/// package needs a dependency from a cached source, it is first installed in
/// the [SystemCache] and then acquired from there.
///
/// Each user-visible source has two classes: a [Source] that knows how to do
/// filesystem-independent operations like parsing and comparing descriptions,
/// and a [BoundSource] that knows how to actually install (and potentially
/// download) those packages. Only the [BoundSource] has access to the
/// [SystemCache].
///
/// ## Subclassing
///
/// All [Source]s should extend this class and all [BoundSource]s should extend
/// [BoundSource]. In addition to defining the behavior of various methods,
/// sources define the structure of package descriptions used in [PackageRef]s,
/// [PackageRange]s, and [PackageId]s. There are three distinct types of
/// description, although in practice most sources use the same format for one
/// or more of these:
///
/// * User descriptions. These are included in pubspecs and usually written by
///   hand. They're typically more flexible in the formats they allow to
///   optimize for ease of authoring.
///
/// * Reference descriptions. These are the descriptions in [PackageRef]s and
///   [PackageRange]. They're parsed directly from user descriptions using
///   [parseRef], and so add no additional information.
///
/// * ID descriptions. These are the descriptions in [PackageId]s, which
///   uniquely identify and provide the means to locate the concrete code of a
///   package. They may contain additional expensive-to-compute information
///   relative to the corresponding reference descriptions. These are the
///   descriptions stored in lock files.
abstract class Source {
  /// The name of the source.

  /// should be interpreted. This will be called during parsing to validate that
  /// the given [description] is well-formed according to this source, and to
  /// give the source a chance to canonicalize the description.
  ///
  /// [containingPath] is the path to the pubspec where this description
  /// appears. It may be `null` if the description is coming from some in-memory
  /// source (such as pulling down a pubspec from pub.dev).
