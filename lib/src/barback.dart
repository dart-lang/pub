/// The currently supported versions of packages that this version of pub works
/// with.
///
/// Pub implicitly constrains these packages to these versions as long as
/// barback is a dependency.
///
/// Users' transformers are loaded in an isolate that uses the entrypoint
/// package's dependency versions. However, that isolate also loads code
/// provided by pub (`asset/dart/transformer_isolate.dart` and associated
/// files). This code uses these packages as well, so these constraints exist to
/// ensure that its usage of the packages remains valid.
///
/// Most constraints here are like normal version constraints in that their
/// upper bound is the next major version of the package (or minor version for
/// pre-1.0.0 packages). If a new major version of the package is released,
/// these *must* be incremented to synchronize with that.
///
/// The constraint on barback is different. Its upper bound is the next *patch*
/// version of barbackâ€”that is, the next version with new features. This is
/// because most barback features need additional serialization code to be fully
/// supported in pub, even if they're otherwise backwards-compatible.
///
/// Whenever a new minor or patch version of barback is published, this *must*
/// be incremented to synchronize with that. See the barback [compatibility
/// documentation][compat] for details on the relationship between this
/// constraint and barback's version.
