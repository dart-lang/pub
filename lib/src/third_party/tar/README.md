# tar

![Build status](https://github.com/simolus3/tar/workflows/build/badge.svg)

This package provides stream-based readers and writers for tar files.

When working with large tar files, this library consumes considerably less memory
than [package:archive](https://pub.dev/packages/archive), although it is slightly slower.

## Reading

To read entries from a tar file, use

```dart
import 'dart:convert';
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:tar/tar.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  final reader = TarReader(File('file.tar').openRead());

  while (await reader.moveNext()) {
    final entry = reader.current;
    // Use reader.header to see the header of the current tar entry
    print(entry.header.name);
    // And reader.contents to read the content of the current entry as a stream
    print(await entry.contents.transform(utf8.decoder).first);
  }
  // Note that the reader will automatically close if moveNext() returns false or
  // throws. If you want to close a tar stream before that happens, use
  // reader.cancel();
}
```

To read `.tar.gz` files, transform the stream with `gzip.decoder` before
passing it to the `TarReader`.

To easily go through all entries in a tar file, use `TarReader.forEach`:

```dart
Future<void> main() async {
  final inputStream = File('file.tar').openRead();

  await TarReader.forEach(inputStream, (entry) {
    print(header.name);
    print(await entry.contents.transform(utf8.decoder).first);
  });
}
```

__Warning__: Since the reader is backed by a single stream, concurrent calls to
`read` are not allowed! Similarly, if you're reading from an entry's `contents`,
make sure to fully drain the stream before calling `read()` again.

## Writing

You can write tar files into a `StreamSink<List<int>>`, such as an `IOSink`:

```dart
import 'dart:convert';
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:tar/tar.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  final output = File('test.tar').openWrite();

  await Stream<TarEntry>.value(
    TarEntry.data(
      TarHeader(
        name: 'hello.txt',
        mode: int.parse('644', radix: 8),
      ),
      utf8.encode('Hello world'),
    ),
  ).pipe(tarWritingSink(output));
}
```

Note that tar files are always written in the pax format defined by the POSIX.1-2001 specification
(`--format=posix` in GNU tar).
When all entries have file names shorter than 100 chars and a size smaller than 8 GB, this is
equivalent to the `ustar` format. This library won't write PAX headers when there is no reason to do so.

To write `.tar.gz` files, you can again transform the stream twice:

```dart
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:tar/tar.dart';

Future<void> write(Stream<TarEntry> entries) {
  return entries
      .transform(tarWriter)
      .transform(gzip.encoder)
      .pipe(File('output.tar.gz').openWrite());
}
```

## Features

- Supports v7, ustar, pax, gnu and star archives
- Supports extended pax headers for long file or link names
- Supports long file and link names generated by GNU-tar
- Hardened against denial-of-service attacks with invalid tar files

Dart tar reader that this library is based on.
